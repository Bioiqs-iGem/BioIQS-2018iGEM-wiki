This is because 99.5% of celiac patients carry one of these alleles, and so, if the patient doesn’t carry any of these, celiac disease is unlikely to appear, as the above predisposition alleles are an almost essential prerequisite for the development of celiac disease. Due to legal reasons, we are not allowed to show the real diagnosis, but the following picture illustrates how the results are presented to verify if the patient has a predisposition to develop celiac disease or not.</p>

Also, the last two methods are notably more aggressive than the first one, which can be done only with a saliva sample.</p>

For this reason, we looked into the most well-known sensor, the NIMA sensor. The NIMA integrates food processing, gluten detection, result interpretation and data transmission, but, from the point of view of celiac people, there are a lot of characteristics missing in order for it to be the perfect one. So, in order to find its main flaws, we have to know how the detection and the food processing works (link a la part d’application design). This example shows us how the sensor is not completely reliable. </p>

Another important improvement for the stakeholders would be the price reduction of our sensor compared to NIMA’s. The NIMA device itself costs $279, and each one-time use capsule is about $5.</p>

At the beginning we had three main ideas, all of these based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We decided to use this technique due to the fact that the vibrant colours produced by their interaction with visible light are strongly dictated by the shape or size of the nanoparticles. The usage of gold nanoparticles also greatly reduces price of the final product compared to antibody-based sensors.</p>

Also, because of our strict commitment to the safety of patients, we decided to use these particles since they are non-cytotoxic.</p>

These interviews to some Bioethics professors let us understand if the project that we wanted to develop, apart from being incredibly useful for people with the disease, could also be considered ethical. We decided to do this interview because some people don’t approve the fact that for some personalized medicine devices a sample of DNA from the patient is needed for the extraction of a specific molecule.</p>

                                    <p class="orange">Everything seems to indicate that personalized medicine will be a key in the near future. Until now, drugs and other products have mostly been used without considering the particularities of each patient. Being able to adapt treatments and interventions to the characteristics of each citizen will obviously bring many advantages.</p>
                                    <p class="orange">In the case of personalized sensors, they can help people to have immediate information about the variations that occur in their bodies, which can be very useful for them and for doctors. On the other hand, we need to be careful and explain very well how these sensors should be used. If they are used so that the patient becomes more autonomous and more aware of their situation and can make decisions about it, it is necessary to apply it. However, unwanted effects may also arise, for example, individuals who carry these sensors could be permanently obsessed with data offered by the device. Rational and measured control over the body and health is positive, exaggerated obsession, no. Therefore, this new technology should be accompanied by a good process of information and support of the patients who are going to use it.

You just have to think about the cell phone. But with these sensors we are talking about a technique that will constantly give us information about the interiorities of our body, on all aspects that can affect our health. Will we make a good use? There are people who use very good mobile phones, while others are "sick" of the cell phone.</p>
                                    <p class="orange">You will also have to be careful with the use of the data offered by these sensors. For example, confidentiality and privacy must always be safeguarded. When we look for a job, in human resources services, can we ask for these sensors to know more about us? The answer should, of course, be negative.</p>

The principle of autonomy: the user should be well informed about this technique, its objectives, its effects, etc. Only if you have good information you can decide freely. The principles of charity and non-malice: to assess the benefits and risks, considering the preferences of the users themselves. And finally, respect the principle of justice: not to discriminate against anybody for reasons of social class, ethnicity, sex, religion, etc. This last principle is important in the case of sensors. Who will benefit from this technique? Will you be able to enter it in the Social Security or only users with a certain income can be allowed?</p>

These are issues that will guide the direction of our society in the future, so all citizens should be well informed, participate in the debates and be able to contribute to the final decisions. It is not what predominates, of course, but perhaps it is time to democratize science, especially that which is being funded with public money.</p>
